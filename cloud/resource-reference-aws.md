## Overview

Unless otherwise specified, new Clusters on Astronomer Cloud are created with a set of default AWS resources that our team has deemed appropriate for most use cases.

Read the following document for a reference of our default resources as well as supported Cluster configurations, including **AWS Region** and **Node Instance Type**.

## Supported Cluster Configurations

Depending on the needs of your team, you may be interested in modifying certain configurations of a new or existing Cluster on Astronomer Cloud. This section provides a reference for which configuration options are supported during the install process.

To create a new Cluster on Astronomer Cloud with a specified configuration, read [Install on AWS](install-aws.md) or [Create a Cluster](create-cluster.md). For instructions on how to make a change to an existing Cluster, read [Modify a Cluster](modify-cluster.md).

### AWS Region

Astronomer Cloud supports the following AWS regions:

- `us-east-1`
- `us-east-2`
- `us-west-1`
- `us-west-2`
- `ca-central-1`
- `sa-east-1`
- `ap-northeast-1`
- `ap-southeast-1`
- `ap-northeast-2`
- `ap-southeast-2`
- `ap-south-1`

Modifying the region of an existing Cluster on Astronomer is not supported. If you're interested in an AWS region that is not on this list, reach out to [Astronomer Support](https://support.astronomer.io).

### Node Instance Type

Astronomer Cloud supports a variety of AWS EC2 instance types. Instance types comprise of varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. All system and Airflow components within a single Cluster are powered by the nodes specified during the Cluster creation or modification process.

For detailed information on each instance type, reference [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). If you're interested in a node type that is not on this list, reach out to [Astronomer Support](https://support.astronomer.io). Not all instance types are supported in all AWS regions.

**m5**

- m5.large
- m5.xlarge (_default_)
- m5.2xlarge
- m5.4xlarge
- m5.8xlarge
- m5.12xlarge
- m5.16xlarge
- m5.24xlarge
- m5.metal

**m5d**

- m5d.large
- m5d.xlarge
- m5d.2xlarge
- m5d.4xlarge
- m5d.8xlarge
- m5d.12xlarge
- m5d.16xlarge
- m5d.24xlarge
- m5d.metal

**t2**

- t2.xlarge

**t3**

- t3.large
- t3.2xlarge

:::info

Currently, a single Cluster on Astronomer Cloud cannot be configured with more than one node instance type. In early 2022, we expect to introduce support for Worker Queues, which will allow you to run Airflow Workers of varying node types and sizes within a single Deployment. If this is something your team is interested in, reach out to us - we'd love to hear from you.

:::

:::tip

With the exception of `m5d` nodes, all suppported node types have a maximum of 20GB of storage per node. If you need more than 20GB of storage, we recommend modifying your cluster to run `m5d` nodes, which Astronomer provisions with NVMe SSD volumes out-of-the-box.

Astronomer plans to support optional ephemeral storage for all node instance types in the first half of 2022.

Keep in mind that leveraging ephemeral storage is not recommended and can be a risk to task resilience. If you need to pass significant data between Airflow tasks, we recommend using an [XCom backend](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/xcoms.html) such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS). For more information and best practices, read our Airflow Guide on [Passing Data Between Airflow Tasks](https://www.astronomer.io/guides/airflow-passing-data-between-tasks).

### RDS Instance Type

Every Astronomer Cluster on AWS is created with and requires an [RDS instance](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/). RDS serves as a primary relational database for the Data Plane and powers the metadata database of each Airflow Deployment within a single Cluster. During the Cluster creation process, you'll be asked to specify an RDS instance type according to your use case and expected workload, but it can be modified at any time.

Astronomer Cloud supports a variety of AWS RDS instance types. Instance types comprise of varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. For detailed information on each instance type, reference [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/instance-types/). If you're interested in an RDS instance type that is not on this list, reach out to [Astronomer Support](https://support.astronomer.io).
