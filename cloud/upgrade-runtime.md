## Overview

New versions of Astronomer Runtime are released regularly to support new features from both Astronomer and Apache Airflow. To take advantage of new functionality, as well as bug and security fixes, we recommend regularly upgrading your Deployment's Runtime version.

Follow this guide to upgrade a Deployment's Airflow environment using the Astronomer Cloud CLI. You can use these steps to upgrade to any major, minor, or patch version of Runtime.

## Step 1: Update Your Dockerfile

1. In your local Astronomer project directory, open your `Dockerfile`.
2. Update the [image](runtime-version-lifecycle-policy.md#runtime-images) in the `FROM` statement of your Dockerfile to a new version of Runtime.

    Once you upgrade Runtime versions, you can't downgrade to an earlier version. The Airflow metadata database structurally changes with each release, making for backwards incompatibility across versions.

    For a table reference of available Runtime versions, see [Available Versions](runtime-version-lifecycle-policy.md#available-runtime-versions). For Astronomer's platform's full collection of Docker Images, go to the [Astronomer Runtime repository on Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/astronomer/astro-runtime?tab=tags). To see what changes are included in each version, read [Runtime Release Notes](runtime-release-notes.md).

## Step 2: Deploy Your Image

To test your upgrade locally:

1. Save the changes to your Dockerfile.
2. In your project directory, run `astrocloud dev stop` followed by `astrocloud dev start`. This restarts the Docker containers for the Airflow Webserver, Scheduler, and Postgres Metadata DB.
3. Access your locally-running Airflow environment at `http://localhost:8080`.

To push your upgrade to Astronomer, run `astrocloud deploy` and select the Deployment you want to upgrade. This will bundle your updated directory, re-build your image and push it to your hosted Deployment on Astronomer Cloud.

## Step 3: Confirm Your Upgrade

1. In the Astronomer UI, go to your upgraded Deployment.
2. Click **Open Airflow**.
3. In the Airflow UI, scroll to the bottom of any page. You should see your new Runtime version in the footer:
