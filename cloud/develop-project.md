import {siteVariables} from '@site/src/versions';

## Overview

This document explains the various ways you can modify and build your Astronomer project to fit your team's use case. Specifically, this guide provides instructions on how to:

- Build and run a project
- Deploy changes to a project
- Add dependencies to your project
- Run on-build commands
- Add connections, pools, and environment variables locally

## Prerequisites

To develop an Astronomer project and test it locally, you need:

- An existing [Astronomer project](create-project.md).
- [The Astronomer Cloud CLI](install-cli.md)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Build and Run a Project Locally

To run your Astronomer project locally, run the following command:

```sh
astrocloud dev start
```

This command builds your project and spins up 3 Docker containers on your machine, each for a different Airflow component:

- **Postgres:** Airflow's metadata database
- **Webserver:** The Airflow component responsible for rendering the Airflow UI
- **Scheduler:** The Airflow component responsible for monitoring and triggering tasks

Once the project builds, you can access the Airflow UI by going to `http://localhost:8080/` and logging in with `admin` for both your username and password. You can also access your Postgres database at `localhost:5432/postgres`.

:::info

The Astronomer Cloud CLI is a wrapper around [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. If you're familiar with Docker Compose, you'll recognize that the `astrocloud dev start` command, for example, is functionally equivalent to `docker compose start`.

:::

:::tip

If you see `Error: cannot start, project already running` when you run this command, it means your local Airflow environment is already running your project. If there are changes you'd like to apply to your project, see [restart your local environment](develop-project.md#make-changes-to-your-project).

:::

### Restart Your Local Environment

To restart your local Airflow environment, run the following two commands:

```sh
$ astrocloud dev stop
$ astrocloud dev start
```

These commands rebuild your image and restart the Docker containers running on your local machine with that new image. Alternatively, you can run just `astrocloud dev stop` to stop your Docker containers without restarting or rebuilding your project.

## Make Changes to Your Project

All Astronomer projects require you to specify a Debian-based Astronomer Runtime image in a `Dockerfile`. When you run your project locally or on Astronomer Cloud, all of your DAG code, packages, and configurations are built into a Docker image based on Astronomer Runtime.

Depending on the change you're making to your Astronomer project, you might have to rebuild your image to run your changes locally.

### DAG Code Changes

All changes made to the following files will be live in your local Airflow environment as soon as you save them to your code editor:

- `dags`
- `plugins`
- `include`

Once you save your changes, refresh the Airflow UI in your browser to see them render.

### Environment Changes

All changes made to the following files require rebuilding your image:

- `packages.txt`
- `Dockerfile`
- `requirements.txt`
- `airflow_settings.yaml`

To rebuild your project after making a change to any of these files, you must [restart your local environment](develop-project.md#restart-your-local-environment).

## Explore Airflow Providers and Modules

As you customize your Astronomer Project and expand your use case for Airflow, we recommend exploring the [Astronomer Registry](https://registry.astronomer.io/), a library of Airflow modules, providers, and DAGs that serve as the building blocks for data pipelines.

The Astronomer Registry includes:

- Example DAGs for many data sources and destinations. For example, you can build out a data quality use case with Snowflake and Great Expectations based on the [Great Expectations Snowflake Example DAG](https://registry.astronomer.io/dags/simple-great-expectations-snowflake-el).
- Documentation for Airflow providers, such as [Databricks](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/databricks), [Snowflake](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/snowflake), and [Postgres](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/postgres). This documentation is comprehensive and based on Airflow source code.
- Documentation for Airflow modules, such as the [PythonOperator](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/apache-airflow/modules/pythonoperator), [BashOperator](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/apache-airflow/modules/bashoperator), and [S3ToRedshiftOperator](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/amazon/modules/s3toredshiftoperator). These modules include guidance on how to set Airflow connections and their parameters.

As you browse the Astronomer Registry, follow this document for instructions on how to install providers as Python packages and make other changes to your Astronomer Project.

## Add Python and OS-level Packages

To build Python and OS-level packages into your Astronomer project, add them to your `requirements.txt` and `packages.txt` files. Add Python packages to your `requirements.txt` and OS-level packages to your `packages.txt` file.

To pin a version of a package, use the following syntax:

```text
<package-name>==<version>
```

To exclusively use Pymongo 3.7.2, for example, add the following line to your `requirements.txt` file:

```text
pymongo==3.7.2
```

If you don't pin a package to a version, the latest version of the package that's publicly available is installed by default.

Once you've saved these packages in your project files, [restart your local environment](develop-project.md#restart-your-local-environment).

### Confirm your package was installed

If you added `pymongo` to your `requirements.txt` file, for example, you can confirm that it was properly installed by running a `docker exec` command into your Scheduler:

1. Run `docker ps` to identify the 3 running docker containers on your machine
2. Copy the container ID of your Scheduler container
3. Run the following:

```
docker exec -it <scheduler-container-id> pip freeze | grep pymongo

pymongo==3.7.2
```

## Add DAGs

DAGs are stored in the `dags` folder of your Astronomer project. To add a DAG to your project, simply add its `.py` file to this folder.

### Add DAG Helper Functions

To build additional helper functions for DAGs into your Astronomer project, we recommend adding a folder with a set of files that can be used by Airflow DAGs.

To do this:

1. Add your directory of helper functions to your local project:

    ```bash
    .
    ├── airflow_settings.yaml
    ├── dags
    │   └── example-dag.py
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── helper_functions
    │   └── helper.py
    ├── include
    ├── packages.txt
    ├── plugins
    │   └── example-plugin.py
    └── requirements.txt
    ```

    In this example, the directory is named `helper_functions`. You can give it any name.

2. [Restart Your Local Environment](develop-project.md#restart-your-local-environment).

To confirm that your helper functions were successfully installed:

1. Run `docker ps` to identify the 3 running docker containers on your machine
2. Copy the container ID of your Scheduler container
3. Run the following command to see your new directory in the container:

    ```bash
    $ docker exec -it <scheduler-container-id> /bin/bash
    bash-4.4$ ls
    Dockerfile  airflow_settings.yaml  helper_functions  logs  plugins  unittests.cfg
    airflow.cfg  dags  include  packages.txt  requirements.txt
    ```

## Configure `airflow_settings.yaml` (Local Development Only)

When you first initialize a new Astronomer project, a file called `airflow_settings.yaml` is automatically generated. With this file, you can configure and programmatically generate Airflow [Connections](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/connection.html), [Pools](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/pools.html), and [Variables](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/variable.html) so that you don't have to manually redefine these values in the Airflow UI every time you restart your project.

As a security measure, `airflow_settings.yaml` works only in local environments. Once you deploy your project to a Deployment on Astronomer, the values in this file will not be included. To more easily manage Airflow secrets on Astronomer, we recommend [configuring a secrets backend](https://docs.astronomer.io/enterprise/secrets-backend).

:::caution
If you are storing your project in a public directory or version control tool, we recommend adding this file to your `.gitignore` or equivalent secret management service.
:::

### Add Airflow Connections, Pools, and Variables

By default, the `airflow_settings.yaml` file includes the following template:

```yaml
airflow:
  connections:
    - conn_id: my_new_connection
      conn_type: postgres
      conn_host: 123.0.0.4
      conn_schema: airflow
      conn_login: user
      conn_password: pw
      conn_port: 5432
      conn_extra:
  pools:
    - pool_name: my_new_pool
      pool_slot: 5
      pool_description:
  variables:
    - variable_name: my_variable
      variable_value: my_value
```

This template includes all possible configuration values. If you want to add another Connection, Pool, or Variable, you can copy the existing fields for the given resource and replace the default values with your own. For instance, to create another Variable, you can add its values under the existing default Variable like so:

```yaml
variables:
  - variable_name: my_variable
    variable_value: my_value
  - variable_name: my_second_variable
    variable_value: value987
```

Once you've saved these values in your `airflow_settings.yaml`, [restart your local environment](develop-project.md#restart-your-local-environment). When you access the Airflow UI for your project at `localhost:8080`, you should see these values in the **Connections**, **Pools**, and **Variables** tabs.

## Run Commands on Build

To run extra system commands when your Airflow image builds, add them to your `Dockerfile` as a `RUN` command. These commands run as the last step in the image build process.

For example, if you want to run `ls` when your image builds, your `Dockerfile` would look like this:

<pre><code parentName="pre">{`FROM quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:${siteVariables.runtimeVersion}
RUN ls
`}</code></pre>

## Override the CLI's Docker Compose File (Local Development Only)

The Astronomer Cloud CLI is built on top of [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), which is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. You can override the CLI's Docker Compose configurations by adding a `docker-compose.override.yml` file to your Astronomer project. Any values in this file override the CLI's default settings whenever you run `astrocloud dev start`.

To see what values you can override, reference the CLI's [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli/blob/main/airflow/include/composeyml.go). The linked file is for the original Astronomer Cloud CLI, but the values here are identical to those used in the Astronomer Cloud CLI. Common use cases for Docker Compose overrides include:

- Modifying the ports at which the Airflow Webserver or Postgres database start on if another service is already running on those same ports (8080 and 5432, respectively). You can override this default and point your containers to a different port.
- Adding extra containers to mimic services that your Airflow environment needs to interact with locally, such as an SFTP server.
- Change the volumes mounted to any of your local containers.

For example, to add another volume mount for a directory named `custom_dependencies`, add the following to your `docker-compose.override.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3.1"
services:
  scheduler:
    volumes:
      - /home/astronomer_project/custom_dependencies:/usr/local/airflow/custom_dependencies:ro
```

Make sure to specify `version: "3.1"` and follow the format of the source code file linked above.

To see your override file live in your local Airflow environment, run the following command for any container running Airflow:

```sh
docker exec -it <container-name> ls -al
```

:::info

The Astronomer Cloud CLI does not support overrides to environment variables that are required globally. For the list of environment variables that Astronomer enforces, see [Global Environment Variables](platform-variables.md). To learn more about environment variables, read [Environment Variables](environment-variables.md).

:::

## Set Environment Variables via .env (Local Development Only)

For Astronomer projects deployed on Astronomer Cloud, we generally recommend [setting environment variables via the Astronomer UI](environment-variables.md#set-environment-variables-via-the-astronomer-ui). For local development, you can use the [Astronomer Cloud CLI](install-cli.md) to set environment variables in your project's `.env` file.

To add Environment Variables locally:

1. Open the `.env` file in your Astronomer project directory.
2. Add your environment variables to the `.env` file.
3. Rebuild your image by running `astrocloud dev start --env .env`.

When setting environment variables in your `.env` file, use the following format:

```
AIRFLOW__CORE__DAG_CONCURRENCY=5
```

:::tip

If your environment variables contain sensitive information or credentials that you don't want to expose in plain-text, you may want to add your `.env` file to `.gitignore` when you deploy these changes to your version control tool.

:::

### Confirm your environment variables were applied

To confirm that the environment variables you just set were applied in your local Airflow environment, first run:

```
docker ps
```

This will output the 3 Docker containers that comprise the Airflow environment on your local machine: the Airflow Scheduler, Webserver, and Postgres metadata database.

Now, create a [Bash session](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/#examples) in your scheduler container by running:

```
docker exec -it <scheduler-container-name> /bin/bash
```

If you run `ls -1` following this command, you'll see a list of running files:

```
bash-5.0$ ls -1
Dockerfile             airflow.cfg            airflow_settings.yaml  dags                   include                logs                   packages.txt           plugins                requirements.txt       unittests.cfg
```

Now, run:

```
env
```

This should output all Environment Variables that are running locally, some of which are set by you and some of which are set by Astronomer by default.

> **Note:** You can also run `cat airflow.cfg` to output _all_ contents in that file.

### Use multiple .env files

The Astronomer Cloud CLI will look for `.env` by default, but if you want to specify multiple files, make `.env` a top-level directory and create sub-files within that folder.

A project with multiple `.env` files might look like the following:

```
my_project
  ├── Dockerfile
  └──  dags
    └── my_dag
  ├── plugins
    └── my_plugin
  ├── airflow_settings.yaml
  ├── .env
    └── dev.env
    └── prod.env
```
