## Overview

A Deployment on Astronomer Cloud is an instance of Astronomer Runtime that is powered by Apache Airflow's core components - a metadata database, a Webserver, one or more Schedulers, and one or more Workers. Every Deployment is hosted on a single Astronomer Cluster, has an isolated set of resources, and operates with a dedicated Postgres metadata database.

This guide walks you through the process of creating and configuring an Airflow Deployment.

## Configure a Workspace

When you first sign up for Astronomer Cloud, you can expect to be invited to a Workspace created for your team. Within a Workspace, you can create Deployments and push DAGs to any Deployment from the Astronomer Cloud CLI or from a CI/CD process. You're free to invite other users to that Workspace and create as many Deployments as you'd like.

## Create a Deployment

To create an Airflow Deployment on Astronomer Cloud:

1. Log in to the [Astronomer UI](https://cloud.astronomer.io) and go to the **Deployments** tab on the left navigation bar.
2. On the top right-hand side of the Deployments page, click **New Deployment**.
3. Set the following:
    - **Name**
    - **Description**
    - **Astronomer Runtime**: By default, the latest version of Astronomer Runtime is selected
    - **Deployment Location**: The Astronomer Cluster in which you want to create this Deployment

3. Click **Create Deployment** and give it a few moments to spin up. Within a few seconds, you should see the following:

    All Deployments show an initial health status of `UNHEALTHY` after their creation. This indicates that the Deployment's Webserver and Scheduler are still spinning up in your cloud. Wait a few minutes for this status to become `HEALTHY` before proceeding to the next step.

4. To access the Airflow UI, select **Open Airflow** on the top right.

## Configure Resource Settings

Once you've created a Deployment with default resources, you can always configure these settings to best fit your use case. For reference, Astronomer Cloud supports the `AU` as the primary resource unit. In this context,

- 1 AU = 0.1 CPU, .375 GB Memory
- 10 AU = 1 CPU, 3.75 GB Memory

Over time, these units are subject to change. Read below for guidelines on how to configure each resource component.

### Worker Resources

Task execution on Astronomer Cloud is powered by [Airflow's Celery Executor](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/executor/celery.html) with [KEDA](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/the-keda-autoscaler), which enables a Deployment's worker count to auto-scale between 1 and 10 depending on real-time workload.

All Celery workers assume the same resources. If you set **Worker Resources** to 10 AU, for example, your Deployment might scale up to 3 workers using 10 AU each for a total of 30 AU (3 CPU, 11.25 GB Memory). By default, the minimum AU allocated towards workers is 10.

The ability to set minimum and/or maximum number of workers is coming soon.

:::info Worker Autoscaling Logic

While the **Worker Resources** setting affects the amount of computing power allocated to each worker, the number of workers running on your Deployment is based solely on the number of tasks in a queued or running state.

The maximum number of tasks that a single worker can execute at once, known in Airflow as Worker Concurrency, is 16. This is currently a system-wide setting on Astronomer Cloud that cannot be changed. As soon as there are more than 16 tasks queued or running at any given time, one or more new workers is spun up to execute the additional tasks. The number of workers running on a Deployment at any given time can be calculated by the following expression:

`[Number of Workers]= ([Queued tasks]+[Running tasks])/16`

This calculation is computed by KEDA every 10 seconds. For more information on how workers are affected by changes to a Deployment, read [What Happens During a Code Deploy](deploy-code.md#what-happens-during-a-code-deploy).

### Scheduler

The [Airflow Scheduler](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/scheduler.html) is responsible for monitoring task execution and triggering downstream tasks once dependencies have been met. By adjusting the **Scheduler Count** slider in the Astronomer UI, you can configure up to 4 Schedulers, each of which will be provisioned with the AU specified in **Scheduler Resources**.

For example, if you set Scheduler Resources to 10 AU and Scheduler Count to 2, your Airflow Deployment will run with 2 Airflow Schedulers using 10 AU each.

If you experience delays in task execution, which you can track via the Gantt Chart view of the Airflow UI, we recommend increasing the AU allocated towards the Scheduler. The default resource allocation is 10 AU.

## Set Environment Variables

Environment Variables can be used to set [Airflow configurations](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html) and custom values, both of which can be applied to your Deployment. For example, you can configure Airflow Parallelism or a secrets backend to manage Airflow Connections.

To set Environment Variables, add them to the corresponding section of the Astronomer UI or in your project's `Dockerfile`. If you're developing locally, they can also be added to a local `.env` file.

For more information on configuring Environment Variables, read [Environment Variables on Astronomer](environment-variables.md).
