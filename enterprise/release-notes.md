## v0.28.0

Release date: February 10, 2022

### Import Identity Provider User Groups as Teams

You now can import existing identity provider (IDP) groups into Astronomer Enterprise as Teams, which are groups of Astronomer users that have the same set of permissions to a given Workspace or Deployment. Importing existing IDP groups as Teams enables swift onboarding to Astronomer and better control over multiple user permissions.

For more information about configuring this feature, read [Import IDP Groups](import-idp-groups.md). To learn more about adding and setting permissions for Teams via the Astronomer UI, read [User Permissions](workspace-permissions.md#via-teams).

### Apply Validation Webhooks to Deployment Creation

You can now configure Astronomer to apply a custom validation webhook whenever a user attempts to create a new Astronomer Deployment.

This feature can be configured in the following section of your `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
houston:
  deployments:
    namespaceFreeFormEntry: true #true|false
    preDeploymentValidationHook: http://my-provision-hook.com/prod-us
    preDeploymentValidationHookTimeout: 30000 # 30 sec
```

For example, you can a validation webhook can reject Deployment creation for any of the following reasons:

- The namespace for the a Deployment is already in use.
- The namespace for the a Deployment is in an incorrect format.
- The user creating the Deployment is unauthorized to complete this action.

### Additional Improvements

- Astronomer now supports `prefer` and `require` SSL modes for connecting to PGBouncer. You can set this SSL mode via the `global.ssl.mode` value in your `config.yaml` file. Note that in v0.28.0, this feature works only with AWS and Azure.
- All metrics dashboards have been upgraded to Grafana 8.
- You can now set [Grafana environment variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/configuration/#override-configuration-with-environment-variables) using the `grafana.extraEnvVars` setting in your `config.yaml` file.
- Added a new **Ephemeral Storage Overwrite Gigabytes** slider to the Git Sync configuration screen. You can configure this slider to allocate more memory for syncing larger Git repos.
- Added a new **Sync Timeout** slider to the Git Sync configuration screen. You can configure this slider to set a maximum allowed length of time for syncing a Git repo.
