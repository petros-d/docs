Astronomer provisions a specific set of resources for each Cluster running on your cloud. Use the following document as a reference for what resources are provisioned, as well as their purpose in the Cluster.

| Resource                                                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Size/ Quantity/ Version |

| [EKS Cluster](https://aws.amazon.com/eks)                                                 | An EKS cluster in your AWS account is required to run the Astronomer data plane, which hosts the resources and data required to execute Airflow tasks.                                                                          | 1x EKS 1.19                         |
| [EC2 Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) (1 node per zone)                    | 2 EC2 instances (nodes) will persist to run the Astronomer data plane. We can scale up to 6 EC2 instances to accommodate for more Airflow Deployments. If you need additional headroom, reach out to us.      | 2x m5.xlarge (4vCPU, 16 GiB Memory) |
| [Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL Instance](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)                                | This RDS instance will be the primary database of your Astronomer Cloud data plane. It will host a metadata database for each Airflow Deployment hosted on this cluster.                                                        | 1x db.r5.large                      |
| [Elastic IPs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) | Elastic IPs are required for outbound access. This is necessary for your cluster to reach across the internet to pull images from and send metadata to the Astronomer control plane, which is hosted by Astronomer.             | 2x                                  |
| Subnets (2 public, 2 private)                                                                    | A total of 4 subnets are created in 2 different AZ regions for redundancy, with 1 public and 1 private per AZ. Public subnets are necessary for the NAT gateway and internet gateway, while private subnets are used for nodes. | 4x                                  |
| Internet Gateway                                                                                 | Required to for outbound internet traffic.                                                                                                                                                                                      | 1x                                  |
